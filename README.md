Welcome to our Emloyee Tracker CMS interface application! This is a command- line application that has been built to manage a company's employee database, using PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Inquirer.  As a business owner, you will be able to view and manage departments, roles, employees, and their current salaries all displayed in table form.  You will also be able to add roles, departments, employees, salaries, and update information to your current database.  Please reference images below of how the application looks when in use and the video demonstration of the application.  If you have any questions please click the link for the repository of this project which will direct you to my GitHub page and contact information.
